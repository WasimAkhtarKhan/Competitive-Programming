# Problem Description

Given a natural number `N`, write an efficient algorithm to print all prime factors of `N`.
For Example, if the input number is `12`, then output should be `2^2 3^1`.  
If the input number is `315`, then output should be `3^2 5^1 7^1`.

Ouput Format: `p1^a1 p2^a2 ... pn^an` where `pn` represent the prime number and `an` represents its power.
