# Problem Description  

You are given sequence of integers, write an algorithm which will compute the sum of sequence ignoring all the subarrays which starts at `6` and ends at `9` (Every `6` will be followed by atleast one `9`). Refer to the examples for understanding:  
```
[1, 3, 5] --> 9
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] --> 9
[2, 1, 6, 9, 11] --> 14
```
